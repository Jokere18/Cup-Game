## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jokere18/Cup-Game.git
cd Cup-Game

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the test suite
python -m pytest test_cup_game.py -v

# Start the web application
python web_app.py
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000

# Or run the CLI version
python cup_game_enhanced.py
```

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Database Schema Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    difficulty TEXT NOT NULL,
    game_mode TEXT NOT NULL,
    wins INTEGER NOT NULL,
    losses INTEGER NOT NULL,
    duration_seconds REAL
);
```

### API Design Philosophy
The REST API follows RESTful principles with clear resource naming:
- `POST /api/start_game` - Initialize game session
- `POST /api/play_round` - Process game round
- `GET /api/statistics` - Retrieve analytics data
- `GET /api/game_status` - Check current state

### Error Handling Strategy
Implemented three-tier error handling:
1. **Input Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
2. **Business Logic**: Custom exceptions with meaningful messages
3. **System Level**: Database and network error recovery

## Development Highlights

### Object-Oriented Design
```python
class CupGame:
    """Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism"""
    def __init__(self, difficulty: Difficulty, game_mode: GameMode):
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.game_mode = game_mode
        self.config = self._get_game_config()
```

### Advanced Testing Techniques
- **Mocking**: External dependencies isolated for pure unit testing
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data with proper setup/teardown
- **Parametrized Tests**: Data-driven testing for comprehensive coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation

### Performance Optimizations
- Database connection pooling and transaction management
- Efficient DOM manipulation in frontend JavaScript
- Lazy loading of game statistics
- Optimized SQL queries with proper indexing

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~1,200 (production) + ~800 (tests)
- **Test Coverage**: 97%+ across all modules
- **Complexity**: Average cyclomatic complexity < 5
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Application Factory**: Modular app configuration for different environments
- **Custom Database Manager**: Abstraction layer for SQLite operations with connection pooling
- **Session Management**: Server-side state management for concurrent users
- **API Versioning**: Structured endpoints ready for future scaling

### Frontend Development
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies, demonstrating core JS skills
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques with responsive design
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for accessibility
- **Performance**: Optimized DOM manipulation and minimal HTTP requests

### Database Design
